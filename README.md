# 🏀 Guess That NBA Player - Frontend

This is the React-based frontend for the **Guess That NBA Player** game — a challenge where users guess a legendary NBA player based on their career stats. All players come from the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team.

## 🔥 About the Game

You’ll be shown a mystery player’s **career stats** (Points, Assists, Rebounds, Steals, Blocks, Finals appearances and wins). Your goal? **Guess the correct player** based on those stats. If you're stuck, hit the **Hint** button to reveal the player’s initials.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **Axios** for API calls
- **Custom CSS** for styling
- Communicates with a backend built in **Express.js** with **Prisma** for the database

---
